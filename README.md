# Aro Golf

Aro golf is a modern approach to improving your golf swing that uses an advanced sensor that attaches to a golf club and pairs to an iOS app to give you insight on your golf swing. I created this app to sharpen my iOS and hardware design skills while also developing a product that I actually want to use. 

## Features

- Real time swing stats (Swing speed, tempo, path
- Graph of each axis of swing
